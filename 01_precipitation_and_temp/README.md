# Description

These scripts carry out some simple data processing and analysis steps for precipitation and temperature data from the US Agricultural Research Service for the Galveston Bay watershed.

The aim is to add useful date information to the unusually formatted data files so they can be loaded into BigQuery, as well as performing some quick data sense checks and map visualisations.
