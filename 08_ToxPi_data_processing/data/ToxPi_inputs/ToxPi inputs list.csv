Medically Underserved Population (MUP)=3 (Are specific sub- groups of people living in a defined geographic area with a shortage of primary health care services and facing economic, cultural or linguistic barriers to access to health care (e.g., homeless, low-income, Medicaid-eligible, Native American, migrant farmworkers, among others population groups).
